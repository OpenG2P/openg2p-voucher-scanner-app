# Voucher Scanner App

This Android app scans the voucher QR code generated by OpenG2P as part of the [Immediate Individual Assistance On-Demand](https://docs.openg2p.org/workflows/on-demand-assistance) workflow.

_The app is a modification of the original [Smartscanner app](https://github.com/newlogic/smartscanner-core). Substantial changes were made to the original app for demonstration of the QR code scan feature. This is a temporary house for the modified code. Work is in progress to merge this code with the original Smartscanner app__.
